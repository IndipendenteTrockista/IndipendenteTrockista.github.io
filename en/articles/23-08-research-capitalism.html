				<img id="articlePicture" src="../../res/pics/2023-08-dio-denaro.jpg">
				<p>Scientific research should be above all and together with art, literature and other forms of study and care of human culture, the ultimate purpose of our society and, with even broader terms, of our species in the historical moment in which it stands.</p>
				<p>Capitalism has apparently had a "changle of plan". Not only didn't it grant a dignified life to a far insufficient portion of humanity, but it also managed to corrupt fields of the human sphere that could have seemed incorruptible, such as those previously listed.</p>
				<p>Without touching on research in a strictly technological field, which is worthy of an entirely separate chapter for how it became a prerogative of multinational companies, that dominate the market, anticipate and replace governments, operate above the law and use personal data as a tradeable asset (quite a well-valued one too).</p>
				<p>First of all it must be noted how research has increasingly shifted its focus on quantity of produced research rather than quality. This behavior is to blame for on the commodification of research, in which researchers have to be as poductive as possible to get funded.</p>
				<p>About funding: the origin of it is a problem as well. An ever-increasing share of funds destined to research comes from private institutions. This negatively influences the aims of research itself, as it will be oriented towards markets to generate profit rather than to fields that would be benificial to society.</p>
				<p>The fact that this phenomenon is well-known to those who want and are able to profit on it and only those who are going to be damaged are unaware of it, is furtherly exacerbating the problem.</p>
				<p>It might seem than that the researchers might end up in the same conditions that artists, writers and musicians have been experiencing for the last decades. Another phenomen that would have catastrophic consequences if it happened to also be present across-the-board is the continous replacement of people who choose the job for passion, talent or ability with individuals seeking profit.</p>
				<p>Well, in case this phenomen were to verify itself in the scientific world (unless it isn't already taking place), the consequences would truly be disastrous, with no fear of being fatalist. It is therefore key to act immediately to oppose the looting of research and its its commodification. For humanity's sake.</p>

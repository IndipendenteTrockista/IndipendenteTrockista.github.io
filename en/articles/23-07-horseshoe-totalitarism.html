				<p>How does one go at destroying the image of communism in the eyes of the people? The western answer consists of a simple yet (apparently) effective formula, i.e. its association with something undeniably "diabolical", such as fascism or (as this point is not as realistic in Italy) nazism.</p>
				<p>Why and how does such a rewrital of history work? First of all differences are nullified and ignored: all results conquered by real socialism are completely forgotten e so is the core marxist ideology, which has, independently from any factual result that may be discussed by oppositors, good intentions.</p>
				<p>Next up is to find common ground. The critique to capitalism might have been a good debate element, even though the support that fascism and nazism drew from the system in which their birth, rise, decline and clandestine survival are contextualised is evident. Additionally, it would be blatantly self-referential to identify them as "enemies of my factual socio-economical system": something more substantial and coherent is required.</p>
				<p>But, as if nothing was said, the West holds true to its name and confirms its ideological emptiness: the association of ideologies remains superficial, if not incorrect. Nazi-fascism and communism are seen as "totalitarianisms". A translation? "Enemies of my declared but not factual socio-political system". Does that ring any bell?</p>
				<p>Yet, it remains evident how the argument doesn't hold. And so is introduced the last element of the western masterclass: adding nothingess to nothingess itself (at least from a logical and ideological point of view, which is the only relevant in the context). This consists in the formulation of fake theories, such as that of the "horseshoe", according to which a hypothetical semicircular shape of a parliament would be more representative if it had its two extremities closer to each other. It could be possible to retaliate with an equally long-reaching invention: that of the fishing hook, in which the far-right actually stays in proximity of the political centre, while the left seems to wander away, almost ostracized by the rest of the political spectrum.</p>
